# BK3D.Arena
A 3D first person shooter on the BK0010? Is it possible? Yes! Despite having only 16K of RAM for the program and a 3MHz processor clock speed, dating back to the early 80s. Imagine that technically this could have existed already in 1985!
System req.:
BK0010, BK0010-01, BK0011M (w/ ANDOS, MKDOS)
To build you can use:
1. TURBO6M (unstable)
2. TURBO7MK (unstable)
